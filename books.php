This book is so enjoyable for us of the modern time to read, to understand the appearance of society in the Edwardian era, the clothing, the speech and the people. I adore the way the people present themselves, with such grace and also such politeness, something I wish we had in our society today. Not only is the storyline of the book thrilling and beautiful, the vernacular language make the entire novel romantic. For me Elizabeth Bennet is a character of such depth and passion, I admire her strength and wit, she is very impressive considering women of this time did not present themselves to be particularly head strong. In relation to the series and the film, I feel as though the series is more historically accurate, and more so of the book, however it is the film for me that really makes me feel apart of it. Perhaps because of the modern day screening and also the beautiful soundtrack which makes the entire thing more emotional. I love the characters both in the series and the film, but I just love Keira Knightly's take on Elizabeth Bennet, her wit amuses me greatly, Mr Darcey in the film is such a mysterious character, and very intriguing. I would give a great deal to meet Jane Austen, she has created a piece of art that many wish was not a fictional novel.</div>

		<div class="comment2">Angels and Demons by Dan Brown was one of the best page-turners I have ever read. From the very beginning I couldnâ€™t put it down. I did not know where Dan Brown would take the story next. Following the main character Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist on his first great adventure was breathtaking. I wanted to learn more, to know the secrets of the Illuminati and the only way to do it was to let the story naturally unfold as I read. I can usually guess what is going to happen in thrillers, but Dan Brown did a wonderful job keeping everything a mystery until absolutely necessary to reveal the secrets.</div>

		<div class="comment3">This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it. 
		I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me.</div>
